You can also get a completely object oriented C++ version written by Lester Godwin in Visual C++ 5.0. It is available as devcpp.zip and implements a DE-version which uses a single array rather than two for the population vectors. The single-array version does not lend itself for parallel computation but is a little more greedy than the two-array version. Another C++ version (VC++ 2010) has been contributed by Charles Brauer. There is also a great and fairly recent C++ contribution by Adrian Michel called the Differential Evolution C++ library.
